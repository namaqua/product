## 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Completed Architectural Choices
1. ✅ Monorepo structure for better organization
2. ✅ Standardized API responses across all modules
3. ✅ JWT with refresh tokens for auth
4. ✅ Nested Set Model for categories
5. ✅ EAV pattern for attributes
6. ✅ Soft delete pattern for data retention
7. ✅ Role-based permission system

### Pending Decisions
1. ⏳ Caching strategy (Redis implementation)
2. ⏳ Search engine integration (Elasticsearch vs PostgreSQL FTS)
3. ⏳ File storage for production (Local vs S3)

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### High Priority
1. **Refresh Token Endpoint** - Returns 401 (needs backend fix)
   - Affects: Session persistence after token expiry
   - Workaround: Re-login when token expires

### Medium Priority
1. **Product Response Enhancement** - Categories/Attributes null
   - Affects: Product detail view completeness
   - Solution: Backend API enhancement needed

### Low Priority
1. **Dashboard Real Data** - Currently using mock data
   - Affects: Dashboard accuracy
   - Solution: Connect to real APIs (planned for today)
