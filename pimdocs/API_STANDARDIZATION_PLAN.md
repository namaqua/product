## 🎯 Standardization Rules

### Collection Responses (Lists/Arrays)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [...],
    "meta": {
      "totalItems": 100,
      "itemCount": 20,
      "page": 1,
      "totalPages": 5,
      "itemsPerPage": 20,
      "hasNext": true,
      "hasPrevious": false
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T..."
}
```

### Action Responses (Create/Update/Delete)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "item": {...},
    "message": "Created successfully"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T..."
}
```

### Single Item Responses (Get by ID)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {...},
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T..."
}
```

## 🚀 Next Session Priority

**Focus: Phase 6 - Auth Module Standardization**

1. **Document Auth endpoints** - Review controller and identify 8 endpoints
2. **Special handling for login/register** - Keep custom token responses
3. **Standardize password endpoints** - Use ActionResponseDto format
4. **Test all Auth endpoints** - Ensure they work correctly

**Ready for:** Auth Module completion (estimated 1 hour)

**Current Status:** 4 of 5 Modules 100% Complete ✅ | Auth Module Final Priority 🎯

**Completed By:** Claude + User  
**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Next Review:** September 10, 2025 - Auth Module completion

## 📊 Progress Summary

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:** 4 of 5 modules are now 100% standardized! 🎉

- **Products Module:** 11 endpoints ✅ 
- **Categories Module:** 15+ endpoints ✅ 
- **Attributes Module:** 14 endpoints ✅ 
- **Users Module:** 9 endpoints ✅ 
- **Auth Module:** 8 endpoints ⏳

**Total Progress: 80% Complete (48+ of 57+ endpoints standardized)**

Only the Auth Module remains, which requires special handling for login/register token responses while standardizing password-related endpoints.
