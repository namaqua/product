# Media Removal Fix - Implementation Report

## 🐛 Issue: Cannot Remove Images from Products

**Reported:** September 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem Description

Users were unable to remove images from products when editing. The removal button would appear to work but images would persist or cause errors.

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Incorrect API Call**: The MediaUpload component was calling `deleteMedia()` which permanently deleted the image from the system instead of just removing it from the product
2. **Missing Dissociation Logic**: When editing a product, removing an image should dissociate it (not delete it)
3. **State Synchronization**: The component wasn't properly updating when existing media was loaded

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed MediaUpload Component** (`/components/media/MediaUpload.tsx`)

#### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
const removeUploadedMedia = async (media: Media) => {
  await mediaService.deleteMedia(media.id); // ❌ Deletes permanently
  // ...
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```typescript
const removeUploadedMedia = async (media: Media) => {
  if (productId) {
    // ✅ Dissociate from product (keeps image in system)
    await mediaService.dissociateFromProducts(media.id, [productId]);
  } else {
    // Delete only when not associated with a product
    await mediaService.deleteMedia(media.id);
  }
  // ...
}
```

### 2. **Added Confirmation Dialog**

- When removing from product: "Remove this image from the product?"
- When deleting permanently: "Delete this image permanently?"

### 3. **Fixed State Management**

Added `useEffect` to sync existing media when editing:
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  setUploadedMedia(existingMedia);
}, [existingMedia]);
```

### 4. **Improved ProductEdit Component** (`/features/products/ProductEdit.tsx`)

- Better error handling for media loading
- Automatic refresh after removal
- Proper async handling of removal operations

## Testing

### Test Script Created
```bash
/shell-scripts/test-media-removal.sh
```

This script tests:
- ✅ Uploading images to products
- ✅ Associating images with products
- ✅ Dissociating images (removal without deletion)
- ✅ Verifying images remain in media library
- ✅ Complete deletion when needed

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Edit a Product with Images:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/products/{id}/edit
   ```

2. **Test Removal:**
   - Hover over an image
   - Click the X button
   - Confirm removal
   - Image disappears from product
   - Image still exists in media library

3. **Test Re-adding:**
   - Upload the same image again
   - It can be re-associated with the product

---

## API Endpoints Used

### Dissociate (Remove from Product):
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/media/{mediaId}/products
Body: { "productIds": ["productId"] }
```
- Removes association between media and product
- Media remains in system
- Can be re-associated later

### Delete (Permanent Removal):
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/media/{mediaId}
```
- Permanently deletes media file
- Removes from filesystem
- Cannot be recovered

---

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Confirmation Messages**
   - Different messages for dissociation vs deletion
   - Prevents accidental permanent deletion

2. **Immediate Visual Feedback**
   - Image disappears immediately from UI
   - Background sync with server

3. **Error Recovery**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic retry logic

---

## Technical Details

### Frontend Changes:
- `MediaUpload.tsx`: Added conditional logic for removal
- `ProductEdit.tsx`: Improved media state management
- `media.service.ts`: Enhanced error handling

### Backend (No Changes Required):
- Existing endpoints already support dissociation
- API follows standardization plan

---

## Verification

Run the following command to verify the fix:
```bash
cd /Users/colinroets/dev/projects/product/shell-scripts
chmod +x test-media-removal.sh
./test-media-removal.sh
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ Images can be removed from products
- ✅ Removed images stay in media library
- ✅ Images can be re-added to products
- ✅ No errors in console

---

## Summary

The media removal issue has been **completely fixed**. Users can now:

1. **Remove images from products** without deleting them
2. **Delete images permanently** when not associated
3. **Re-use images** across multiple products
4. **Receive clear confirmations** before actions

The fix maintains backward compatibility and follows the API standardization plan.
