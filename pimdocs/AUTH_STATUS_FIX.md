# Auth Status Fix - Development Mode

## The Issue:
When you tried to login with `john@example.com`, you got:
```json
{"message":"Account is not active","error":"Unauthorized","statusCode":401}
```

## Why It Happened:
- New users were created with status = `PENDING`
- They needed email verification to become `ACTIVE`
- Login requires users to be `ACTIVE`

## The Fix:
Changed registration to automatically set users as `ACTIVE` for development:
```typescript
// Before (production mode):
status: UserStatus.PENDING,
emailVerified: false

// After (development mode):
status: UserStatus.ACTIVE,
emailVerified: true
```

## How to Apply the Fix:

### 1. Restart the Server:
The code is already updated. Just restart:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Fix Existing Users (like john@example.com):
```bash
cd /Users/colinroets/dev/projects/product/shell-scripts
chmod +x activate-all-users.sh
./activate-all-users.sh
```

### 3. Test New Registration:
```bash
chmod +x test-active-auth.sh
./test-active-auth.sh
```

## Result:
âœ… New users can login immediately
âœ… No email verification needed in development
âœ… Existing users can be activated with the script

## For Production:
Remember to change back to `PENDING` status and implement email verification!

## Test Commands:

### Register & Login Test:
```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mary@example.com","password":"Mary123!","firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Jane"}'

# Login immediately (no verification needed!)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mary@example.com","password":"Mary123!"}'
```

Your auth system is now developer-friendly! ðŸš€
