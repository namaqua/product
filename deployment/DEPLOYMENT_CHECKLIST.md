## Quick Health Check Commands

```bash
# Check all services
docker ps

# Check system resources
free -h && df -h

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3010/health

# Check logs
docker compose logs --tail=50

# Check database connections
docker exec postgres-pim psql -U pim_user -d pim_production -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check Nginx
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down

# Restore database backup
docker exec postgres-pim psql -U pim_user -d pim_production < backup.sql

# Start previous version
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Verify services
docker ps && curl http://localhost:3010/health
```
