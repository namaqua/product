## üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# Start all services
cd /Users/colinroets/dev/projects/product
docker-compose up -d
cd engines && npm run start:dev

# Check Elasticsearch
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders
1. **PostgreSQL runs on port 5433** (not 5432)
2. Database is in Docker container
3. Use `docker exec` for database access
4. Follow existing module patterns
5. Backend is sacrosanct - adapt frontend
6. Use open source tools only
