# Credit Limit Currency Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-01-17
## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
The credit limit and other monetary fields now dynamically use the currency selected for each account, rather than a fixed currency symbol. This provides better clarity and consistency for multi-currency operations.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Component Created
**`/admin/src/components/common/CurrencyInput.tsx`**
- Reusable currency input component
- Dynamic currency symbol display
- Automatic padding adjustment for symbol length
- Currency code shown in label
- Includes CurrencyDisplay component for read-only displays

### 2. Components Updated

#### AccountCreate.tsx
✅ Credit Limit field now uses CurrencyInput component
✅ Annual Revenue field now uses CurrencyInput component
✅ Currency symbol updates when currency selection changes
✅ Added information notice about currency behavior

#### AccountEdit.tsx
✅ Credit Limit field now uses CurrencyInput component
✅ Annual Revenue field now uses CurrencyInput component

## Key Features

### Dynamic Currency Display
- Credit limit shows the symbol of the selected currency

### Supported Currencies
All currencies from the configuration are supported:
- EUR: € (Euro)
- CHF: CHF (Swiss Franc)
- GBP: £ (British Pound)
- USD: $ (US Dollar)

2. **Consistency**: All monetary fields use the same currency
3. **Information Notice**: Clear warning that changing currency doesn't convert values
4. **Professional Formatting**: Proper currency symbol positioning and formatting

## Important Behavior

### No Automatic Conversion
⚠️ The system does NOT perform currency conversion when the currency is changed:
- Values remain numerically the same
- Only the currency designation changes
- Users are warned via an info notice

### Info Notice
Added to both Create and Edit forms:
> "All monetary values (Credit Limit, Annual Revenue) will be displayed and stored in the selected currency. Changing the currency will not convert existing values."

## Testing

### Test Script Created
**`/shell-scripts/test-credit-limit-currency.sh`**
- Validates CurrencyInput component exists
- Checks implementation in AccountCreate and AccountEdit
- Verifies currency configuration
- Displays summary of behavior

### How to Test Manually
1. Create a new account
   - Observe default currency (EUR) in credit limit field

   - Enter a value and save

2. Edit an existing account
