📊 FINAL RESULTS
================
✅ Passed: 2/5 tests
❌ Failed: 3/5 tests

⚠️  Some tests failed. Check the output above for details.
   Fix the failing endpoints before proceeding to next phase.

🔄 Next Steps:
   1. If all tests pass: Continue to Phase 6 (Auth Module - Final!)
   2. If tests fail: Fix the failing endpoints and re-run this test
   3. Update MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md with progress

📈 Overall Progress: 80% Complete (4 of 5 modules done!)
