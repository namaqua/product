- 9 fully standardized endpoints

### Frontend Components Created/Updated

| ProductEdit | `/features/products/ProductEdit.tsx` | ✅ MediaUpload integration |
| ProductDetails | `/features/products/ProductDetails.tsx` | ✅ Gallery + Lightbox |
| MediaService | `/services/media.service.ts` | Complete API client |

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Media table with all fields
media (id, filename, path, url, type, mimeType, size, ...)

-- Product-Media relationships
product_media (productId, mediaId, isPrimary, sortOrder)
```
