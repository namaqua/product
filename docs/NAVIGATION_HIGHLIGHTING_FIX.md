# Navigation Highlighting Fix

## Issue
The "Accounts" navigation item was always highlighted when visiting any account-related page like:
- `/accounts/relationships`
- `/accounts/user-assignments`
- `/accounts/dashboard`

This was because all these paths start with `/accounts`.

## Root Cause
The `isCurrentPath` function in ApplicationShell.tsx was using:
```typescript
location.pathname.startsWith(href)
```

This meant `/accounts` would match ANY path starting with `/accounts`.

## Solution
Modified the `isCurrentPath` function to check for exact matches for base navigation items:

```typescript
// For /accounts, only match exact path (not sub-paths)
if (href === '/accounts') {
  return currentPath === '/accounts' || currentPath === '/accounts/';
}

// Similar for /products, /users, /settings
```

## How It Works Now

### Before Fix:
- Path: `/accounts/relationships`
- Highlighted: **Accounts** ✅ (wrong), **Relationships** ✅

### After Fix:
- Path: `/accounts/relationships`
- Highlighted: **Relationships** ✅ (correct)

### Navigation Highlighting Rules:
1. **Exact Match**: `/accounts` only highlights when on exactly `/accounts`
2. **Sub-paths**: `/accounts/relationships` only highlights "Relationships"
3. **Section Highlight**: "Account Engine" section stays highlighted when any child is active

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/accounts` - Only "Accounts" should be highlighted
2. Navigate to `/accounts/relationships` - Only "Relationships" should be highlighted
3. Navigate to `/accounts/user-assignments` - Only "User Assignments" should be highlighted
4. Navigate to `/products` - Only "Products" should be highlighted (not affecting product sub-pages)

## Files Modified
- `/admin/src/components/layouts/ApplicationShell.tsx`

## Impact
This fix ensures proper navigation visual feedback, making it clear to users exactly which page they're currently viewing.
