# Media Library Frontend Fixes - Complete Summary

## Date: December 2024
## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ **Image Thumbnails Fixed**
**Problem**: Images were showing as green placeholder icons instead of actual thumbnails
**Solution**: 
- Fixed URL construction in `MediaThumbnail.tsx` 
- Used the main image URL directly from the API response
- Added proper error handling and debug logging
- Removed complex thumbnail URL logic that was failing

### 2. ✅ **"NaN undefined used" Fixed**
**Problem**: Footer showed "NaN undefined used" instead of the actual storage size
**Solution**:
- Added null/undefined checks in `formatFileSize()` function
- Added defensive programming to handle missing stats data
- Updated type definitions to make some stats properties optional
- Added fallback to '0 B' when stats are unavailable

### 3. ✅ **Stats Display Improvements**
**Fixed in**: `MediaLibrary.tsx`, `MediaFilters.tsx`
- Made stats properties optional in TypeScript interfaces
