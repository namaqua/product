# Media Library Frontend Fixes

## Date: December 2024
## Sprint: PIM Import/Export Sprint

## Overview
Fixed critical issues in the Media Library frontend while maintaining the existing backend API patterns.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **MediaUploadWizard Implementation**
- **Problem**: Component was just a placeholder with no functionality
- **Solution**: Implemented full upload wizard with:
  - Drag & drop support using react-dropzone
  - Multiple file upload capability
  - Upload progress tracking
  - File preview for images
  - Success/error status indicators
  - Support for images, videos, PDFs, and documents
  - File size validation (50MB max)
  - Integration with product associations

### 2. **Aspect Ratio Handling**
- **Problem**: Used deprecated `aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1` classes that require a plugin
- **Solution**: Updated to use native Tailwind's `aspect-square` class for 1:1 ratio

### 3. **MediaDetailsModal Implementation**
- **Problem**: Component was incomplete
- **Solution**: Implemented full modal with:
  - Image/video preview
  - File metadata display
  - Edit functionality for alt text, title, and description
  - Copy URL to clipboard
  - Download file capability
  - Delete confirmation

### 4. **MediaBulkActions Implementation**
- **Problem**: Component was missing
- **Solution**: Created bulk actions bar with:
  - Selection count display
  - Select all/clear selection
  - Bulk delete with confirmation

### 5. **MediaFilters Implementation**
- **Problem**: Component was incomplete
- **Solution**: Implemented filters sidebar with:
  - Media type filtering (images, videos, documents, other)
  - Library statistics display
  - Primary media filter
  - Product association filter
  - Clear all filters option

### 6. **MediaListView Implementation**
- **Problem**: List view was not implemented
- **Solution**: Created table-based list view with:
  - Sortable columns
  - File preview thumbnails
  - Inline actions (view, edit, delete)
  - Selection mode support
  - Primary media badge

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/colinroets/dev/projects/product/shell-scripts
   chmod +x test-media-library.sh
   ./test-media-library.sh
   ```

2. **Test Upload Functionality**:
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Drag and drop multiple files or click to select
   - Verify file previews appear
   - Click "Upload X Files" to start upload
   - Verify progress bar and status indicators

3. **Test Gallery View**:
   - Verify thumbnails display correctly with 1:1 aspect ratio
   - Check type badges (green for images, purple for videos, etc.)
   - Hover over cards to see action buttons
   - Click on a card to open details modal

4. **Test List View**:
   - Toggle to list view using the icon buttons
   - Verify table displays with all columns
   - Test inline actions (view, edit, delete)

5. **Test Filters**:
   - Click "Filters" button to open sidebar
   - Test filtering by media type
   - Check statistics display
   - Test "Clear all" functionality

6. **Test Selection Mode**:
   - Click "Select" button to enter selection mode
   - Select multiple items
   - Test bulk delete functionality
   - Test "Select All" and "Clear Selection"

7. **Test Media Details Modal**:
   - Click on any media item
   - Test edit functionality (alt text, title, description)
   - Test "Copy URL" button
   - Test "Download" button
   - Test delete functionality

## API Endpoints Used
All endpoints are working with the existing backend:
- `GET /api/media` - List media with pagination
- `POST /api/media/upload` - Upload single file
- `GET /api/media/:id` - Get media details
- `PUT /api/media/:id` - Update media metadata
- `DELETE /api/media/:id` - Delete media
- `POST /api/media/bulk-delete` - Bulk delete
- `GET /api/media/stats` - Get library statistics

## Dependencies Added
All dependencies were already present in package.json:
- `react-dropzone` - For drag & drop upload
- `@heroicons/react` - For icons
- `axios` - For API calls
- `tailwindcss` - For styling

## Color Scheme
Following the project's UI guidelines:
- **Primary**: Blue (`blue-600`)
- **Success**: Green (`green-600`)
- **Error**: Red (`red-600`)
- **Warning**: Orange (`orange-500`)

## Known Limitations
1. Batch upload endpoint (`/api/media/upload/batch`) exists in backend but single upload is used for better error handling
2. Image optimization features exist in backend but UI for triggering them is planned for Phase 2
3. Advanced metadata editing (EXIF data, etc.) is available in backend but not exposed in UI yet

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- [ ] Add batch upload optimization
- [ ] Implement image optimization UI
- [ ] Add advanced metadata editing
- [ ] Implement drag-to-reorder functionality
- [ ] Add image cropping/editing tools
- [ ] Implement folder/collection organization

## Notes
- Backend remains untouched as requested ("Backend sacrosanct")
- All fixes use existing API patterns
- UI follows Tailwind Pro design patterns established in the project
- No additional dependencies required
