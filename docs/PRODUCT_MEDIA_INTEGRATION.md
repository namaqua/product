## API Integration

### Media Service Methods Used
```typescript
// Get media for a product
mediaService.getProductMedia(productId)

// Associate media with products
mediaService.associateWithProducts(mediaId, [productId])

// Update media (set as primary)
mediaService.updateMedia(mediaId, { isPrimary: true })

// Get media list with filters
mediaService.getMediaList(params)
```

## User Workflows

2. Fill in product details
3. Scroll to "Product Media" section
4. Choose one of:
   - Click "Upload New" to upload files directly
   - Click "Select from Library" to choose existing media
5. Set primary image if needed (star icon)
6. Save product - media is automatically associated

### 2. Managing Media for Existing Product

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript

2. Media stored in local state
3. On product save:
   - Create/update product first
   - Get product ID
   - Associate each media item with product
   - Set primary flag if specified
4. On product load:
   - Fetch product data
   - Fetch associated media
   - Display in media section

- No image editing tools
- Single file type filter only

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Phase 2**:
   - Enable drag-and-drop reordering
   - Bulk media operations
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Media categories/tags

2. **Phase 3**:
   - Image cropping/editing
   - Video thumbnail selection
   - AI-powered auto-tagging
   - CDN integration

## API Endpoints Used
```
GET    /api/media                     # List media with filters
POST   /api/media/upload              # Upload new media
GET    /api/media/product/:productId  # Get product media
POST   /api/media/:id/products        # Associate with products
PUT    /api/media/:id                 # Update media (primary flag)
DELETE /api/media/:id/products        # Dissociate from products
```

## Troubleshooting

### Media Not Showing
- Check console for API errors
- Verify media service URLs
- Check authentication token
- Ensure Docker containers running

### Upload Failures
- Check file size limits (50MB max)
- Verify file types allowed
- Check disk space
- Review upload directory permissions

### Association Issues
- Ensure product saved before media
- Check product ID validity
- Verify media IDs exist
- Review console for API errors

## Success Metrics
