# Account Address Fields Update - Summary

## Date: December 19, 2024

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (NestJS)

1. **Account Entity (`/engines/src/modules/accounts/entities/account.entity.ts`)**
   - Made `primaryPhone` field nullable (string | null)
   - Made `primaryEmail` field nullable (string | null)

2. **CreateAccountDto (`/engines/src/modules/accounts/dto/create-account.dto.ts`)**
   - Changed `headquartersAddress` from required to optional (?)
   - Changed `primaryPhone` from required to optional (?)
   - Changed `primaryEmail` from required to optional (?)
   - Updated decorators from @ApiProperty to @ApiPropertyOptional
   - Added @IsOptional() validators to these fields

3. **Database Migration**
   - Created migration file: `1734651000000-MakeAccountContactFieldsOptional.ts`
   - Alters database schema to make primaryPhone and primaryEmail nullable

### Frontend Changes (React)

1. **AccountCreate Component (`/admin/src/features/accounts/AccountCreate.tsx`)**
   - Changed initial state to set addresses as `undefined` instead of empty objects
   - Updated address field handling to properly initialize addresses when first edited
   - Added "(Optional)" label to all address section headers
   - Fixed value bindings to handle undefined addresses (using `|| ''`)
   - Updated copyHeadquarters function to check if headquarters address exists first

2. **AccountEdit Component (`/admin/src/features/accounts/AccountEdit.tsx`)**
   - Same changes as AccountCreate for consistency
   - Addresses now initialize as `undefined` when loading account data
   - All address fields properly handle undefined values
   - Added "(Optional)" labels to address sections

3. **TypeScript Types (`/admin/src/types/dto/accounts.ts`)**
   - Already had addresses as optional - no changes needed

## Result

After these changes:
- Accounts can be created without any address information
- Accounts can be updated without providing addresses
- Phone and email fields are now optional
- The UI clearly indicates that addresses are optional
- No validation errors will occur when addresses are not provided

## Running the Update

To apply these changes:

```bash
cd /Users/colinroets/dev/projects/product/shell-scripts
chmod +x update-account-addresses.sh
./update-account-addresses.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the backend TypeScript code
2. Run the database migration
3. Restart the backend service

## Verification

To verify the changes work:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/accounts/new
2. Create a new account with only the Legal Name filled in
3. Leave all address fields empty
4. The account should save successfully without validation errors
