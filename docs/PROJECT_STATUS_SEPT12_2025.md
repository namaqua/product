# PIM Project Status Update - September 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

The PIM system is **98% feature-complete** with all core modules operational. The immediate priority is completing the Product Variants implementation (currently 20% done) to achieve 100% MVP within 2 weeks.

## Current System State

### Backend (100% Core Complete)
- **66+ API endpoints** across 6 modules
- Full authentication with JWT & refresh tokens
- Complete CRUD for all entities
- PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- Docker containerization
- API documentation via Swagger

### Frontend (95% Complete)
| Module | Status | Features |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Auth** | âœ… Complete | Login, logout, guards, token management |
| **Dashboard** | âœ… Complete | Dual dashboards with charts, metrics, activity feeds |
| **Products** | âœ… Complete | Full CRUD, duplicate, archive, basic variants |
| **Categories** | âœ… Complete | Tree view, drag-drop, nested operations |
| **Attributes** | âœ… Complete | All 13 types, options, groups, validation |
| **Media** | âœ… Complete | Upload, gallery, lightbox, associations |
| **Users** | âœ… Complete | Full CRUD, roles, bulk ops, profile |

## ðŸ”§ Active Priority: Product Variants

### Current State
- **Frontend**: Basic ProductVariants.tsx component (40% complete)
  - âœ… Parent-child relationships
  - âœ… Quick templates (sizes, colors)
  - âœ… Auto-SKU generation
  - â¬œ Wizard UI needed
  - â¬œ Matrix view needed

- **Backend**: No variant-specific endpoints (0% complete)
  - â¬œ Database migration needed
  - â¬œ DTOs not created
  - â¬œ Service methods missing
  - â¬œ Controller endpoints missing

### Implementation Plan
**Week 1 (Sept 12-19)**: Backend Development
- Database migration for variant fields
- Create 6 variant DTOs
- Implement 12+ service methods
- Add 10+ controller endpoints

**Week 2 (Sept 19-26)**: Frontend Enhancement
- Build VariantWizard component
- Create VariantMatrix view
- Implement variant service
- Integrate with ProductEdit

**Reference**: `/docs/VARIANT_IMPLEMENTATION_CONTINUATION.md`

## What's Left After Variants

### Near-term (Q4 2025)
1. **Import/Export** - CSV/Excel with mapping
2. **Bulk Operations** - Mass updates interface
3. **Advanced Search** - Faceted filtering

### Long-term (2026)
- Workflow management
- AI-powered features
- Mobile application
- Real-time collaboration

## Known Issues

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| No variant backend | High | **ACTIVE** |
| Refresh token 401 | Medium | Defer |
| Categories null in responses | Low | Defer |

## Quick Reference

### Access Points
```bash
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:3010/api/v1
Swagger: http://localhost:3010/api/docs
Login: admin@test.com / Admin123!
```

### Start Commands
```bash
cd /Users/colinroets/dev/projects/product
docker-compose up -d
cd engines && npm run start:dev
cd ../admin && npm run dev
```

### Project Metrics
- **Total Endpoints**: 66+ (76+ after variants)
- **Frontend Completion**: 95% (core), 40% (variants)
- **Time to MVP**: 2 weeks
- **Code Coverage**: ~45%

## Timeline to MVP

```
Sept 12-19: Variant Backend Implementation
Sept 19-26: Variant Frontend Enhancement
Sept 26-Oct 3: Testing & Polish
October 3, 2025: MVP Launch
```

## Key Decisions

1. **Focus on Variants** - Core PIM functionality
2. **Simple Implementation** - Avoid over-engineering
3. **Backend First** - Frontend adapts to backend
4. **2-Week Sprint** - Aggressive but achievable

## Success Criteria

### MVP Complete When:
- âœ… All core CRUD operations work
- âœ… Media management functional
- âœ… User management complete
- ðŸ”§ **Product variants operational** (IN PROGRESS)
- â¬œ Basic import/export working

### Performance Targets:
- API response < 200ms
- Page load < 1 second
- Support 100+ variants without lag
- Zero data loss in operations

## Conclusion

With 98% of core features complete, the PIM system only needs Product Variants implementation to reach MVP. The 2-week timeline is aggressive but achievable given the clear plan and existing foundation. After variants, the system will be production-ready for basic PIM operations.
