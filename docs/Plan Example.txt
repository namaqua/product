Subscription Engine Development Plan Created
I've created a comprehensive development plan with 25 bytesized steps and saved it to:
/docs/SUBSCRIPTION_ENGINE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
ðŸ“‹ Plan Highlights:
Structure:

25 Development Steps - Each taking 1-3 hours
4 Phases - Foundation â†’ Core Features â†’ Advanced â†’ Testing
Estimated Duration - 2-3 weeks total

Key Features Included:

##

Each Step Includes:

Clear objectives
Specific deliverables
Time estimates
Checklist items

Standards Enforced:

âœ… CamelCase throughout (as per our discussion)
âœ… Standardized API responses
âœ… TypeORM best practices
âœ… NestJS module structure

The plan is ready for execution, starting with Step 1: Module Setup. Each step is small enough to complete in one sitting, making progress trackable and manageable.
Would you like me to begin implementation with Step 1, or would you prefer to review and adjust the plan first?
